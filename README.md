# FoodTruckProject

# Overview
- The projects main objective is to obtain data for a group of food trucks through a users input. The data would be put an array that was developed by a constructor. This constructor would allow data to be secure, but also allow data to be connected through methods with the use of instances. Once the array is developed, the user gets four options to choose from a menu method. The user can choose to view all current food trucks, see the average rating of all food trucks or see the highest rating food truck. This menu will keep repeating until the user picks the fourth option to quit, it is then that the system with bid farewell to the user and terminate.

# Lessons Learned
- I learned that there are many different ways to go about coding this. I changed the array towards the end of coding in order to make my methods much easier. However, it did not affect the user's input as they can still only put up to five different food trucks or less if they please. By setting the array to six, I was able to simplify half of my methods if statements to (i < 6) or if the food truck == null because they were only allowed to enter 5 food trucks. 

I also further solidified my understanding of non-static data, because of the need to associate then with an instance or a parameter.

I learned the importance of "get" methods as they allow for comparisons to be made within these very methods themselves.

# Technolgies Used
- Java was the language used for coding the FoodTruckProject.
- Eclipse was used to code and fix any errors within the code.
- git was used to push the java file to github.
- github is the website where we pushed our code to get it graded.
- A switch statement was used to cycle through the options within the menu.
- Multiple variations of for loops and while loops were used to iterate until the user chose to quit or a limit was reached. It was also used to cycle through the data and display it.
- class and methods were used to gather and develop ways to easier display and run the project.
- In order to connect the methods and classes, an instance of the food truck array was developed.
